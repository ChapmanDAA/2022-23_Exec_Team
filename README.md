# Chapman Data Analytics Association

Hello! This is where we post various resources for the club. Please contact us with any questions at dataanalytics@chapman.edu.

## Club Description

The Data Analytics Association (DAA) is open to all years and majors at Chapman. Members _do not_ need to have prior programming experience to be a part of this club. The DAA's leadership comes from various backgrounds and experience levels, and our goal is for our club's offerings to reflect this range as well. This club provides the following:

- hear from industry experts
- create experiential opportunities outside of required course work
- support the transition from being a student to a professional
- build an employment network for alumni

Annika is a senior with a Data Analytics major and an English minor. They are currently working towards a cybersecurity certification and seeking a full-time job as their remote data analytics internship comes to an end. You can catch them reading a (hopefully) good book or fueling their coffee addiction in their down time.
